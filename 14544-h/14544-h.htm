    <p>["I now send you," writes this popular and delightful
    Author, "the latest of the Novels in which I mingle delicate
    sentiment with Hebridean or Highland scenery, and bring the
    wisdom of a Londoner to bear directly upon the unsophisticated
    innocence of a kilt-wearing population. I am now republishing
    my books in a series. I'll take short odds about my
    salmon-flies as compared with anyone else's, and am prepared to
    back my sunsets and cloud-effects against the world. No takers.
    I thought not. Here goes!"]</p>

    <p>I held it in my right hand, toying with it curiously, and
    not without pleasure. It was merely a long, wooden pen-holder,
    inky and inert to an unappreciative eye, but to me it was a
    bright magician, skilled in the painting of glowing pictures, a
    traveller in many climes, a tried and trusted friend, who had
    led me safely through many strange adventures and much uncouth
    dialect. "Old friend," I said, addressing it kindly, "shall you
    and I set out together on another journey? We have seen many
    countries, and the faces of many men, and yet, though we are
    advancing in years, the time has not yet come for me to lay you
    down, as having no need of you. What say you&mdash;shall we
    start once more?" I hear a confused sound as of men who murmur
    together, and say, "We have supped full of horrors, and have
    waded chin-deep in Zulu blood; we have followed the Clergy of
    the Established Church into the recesses of terrible crimes,
    and have endured them as they bared their too sensitive
    consciences to our gaze. We pine for simpler, and more
    wholesome pleasures. Now," I continued, "if only Queen TITA and
    the rest will help us, I think we can do something to satisfy
    this clamour." For all answer, my pen-holder nestled lovingly
    in my hand. I placed my patent sunset-nib in its mouth, waved
    it twice, dipped it once, and began.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

    <p>The weary day was at length sinking peacefully to rest
    behind the distant hills. The packed and tumbled clouds lay
    heavily towards the West, where a gaunt jagged tower of rock
    rose sheer into the sky. And lo! suddenly a broad shaft of
    blood-red light shot through the brooding cumulus and rested
    gorgeously upon the landscape. On each side of this a thin
    silvery veil of mist crept slowly up and hung in impalpable
    folds. The Atlantic sand stretching away to the North shone
    with the effulgence of burnished copper. And now brilliant
    flickers of coloured light, saffron, purple, green and rose
    danced over the heaven's startled face. The piled clouds opened
    and showed in the interspace a lurid lake of blood tinged with
    the pale violet of an Irishwoman's eyes. Great pillars of flame
    sprang up rebelliously and spread over the burning horizon.
    Then a strange, soft, yellow and vaporous light raised its
    twelve bore breech-loading ejector to its shoulder and shot
    across the Cryanlaughin hills, and the cattle shone red in the
    green pastures, and everything else glowed, and the whole world
    burned with the bewildering glare of a stout publican's nose in
    a London fog. And silence came down upon the everlasting hills
    whose outlines gleamed in a prismatic&mdash;</p>

    <p>"That will do," said a mysterious Voice, "the paint-box is
    exhausted!"</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER III.</h4>

    <p>I was shocked at this rude interruption.</p>

    <p>"Sir!" I said, "I cannot see you, though I hear your voice.
    Will you not disclose yourself?"</p>

    <p>"Nonsense, man," said the aggravating, but invisible one,
    "do not waste time. Let us get on with the story. You know what
    comes next. <i>Revenons à nos saumons.</i> Ha, Ha! spare the
    rod and spoil the book!"</p>

    <p>I was vexed, but I had to obey, and this was the result:</p>

    <p>The pools were full of gleaming curves of silver, each one
    belonging to a separate salmon of gigantic size fresh run from
    the sea. The foaming Black Water tumbled headlong over its
    rocks and down its narrow channel. DONALD, the big keeper,
    stood industriously upon the bank arranging flies. "I hef been
    told," he observed, "tat ta English will be coming to
    Styornoway, and there will be no more Gaelic spoken. But
    perhaps it iss not true, for they will tell many lies. I am a
    teffle of a liar myself."</p>

    <p>And lo! as we watched, the grey sky seemed to be split in
    two by an invisible wedge, and a purple gleam of light
    shot&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Stow that!" said the Voice, "I have allowed you to put in a
    patch of Gaelic, but I really cannot let you do any more
    sun-pictures. Try and think that it is a close time for
    landscapes, and don't let the light shoot again for a bit."</p>

    <p>"All right," I retorted, not without annoyance, "but you'll
    just have to make up your mind to lose that salmon. It was a
    magnificent forty-pounder, and, if it hadn't been for your
    ridiculous interruption, we should have landed him splendidly
    in another six pages."</p>

    <p>"As you like," said the Voice.</p>

    <h4>CHAPTER IV.</h4>

    <p>And now our journey was drawing to a close. Out of the
    solemn hush of the purple mountains we had passed slowly
    southwards back to the roar and the turmoil of the London
    streets. And many friends had said farewell to us. SHEILA with
    her low, sweet brow, her exquisitely curved lips, and her soft
    blue eyes had held us enraptured, and we had wept with
    COQUETTE, and fiercely cheered the WHAUP while he held WATTIE
    by the heels, and made him say a sweer. And we had talked with
    MACLEOD and grown mournful with Madcap VIOLET, and had seen
    many another fresh and charming face, and had talked Gaelic
    with gusto and discrimination. And Queen TITA had sped with us,
    and we had adored BELLE, and yet we cried for more. But now the
    dream-journey was past, and lo! suddenly the whole heaven was
    blazing with light, and a bright saffron band lay
    across&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Steady there!" said the Voice. "Remember your promise!"</p>

    <center>
        THE END.

    <h3>SAINTS OR SINNERS?</h3>

    <h4>[BY SPECIAL WIRE.]</h4>

    <p>MELBOURNE.&mdash;It is said, on good authority, that the
    favourite books of the interesting prisoner now in custody are,
    the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, an Australian Summary of the
    <i>Newgate Calendar</i>, and the poetry of the late Dr. Watts.
    He has also expressed himself as pleased with Mrs. Humphrey
    Ward's latest work of fiction, though he does not quite approve
    of the theological opinions of the writer.</p>

    <p>PARIS, <i>Tuesday</i>.&mdash;The supposed author of the
    dynamite outrages, is the recipient of numerous presents in
    prison, sent him by male and female admirers, and persons
    anxious for his conversion and his autograph. The edition of
    <i>Thomas à Kempis</i>, recently given him, is a most valuable
    antique copy; but he complains of the print as unsuited to his
    eyesight.</p>

    <p>MELBOURNE. <i>Later</i>.&mdash;The Solicitor engaged on
    behalf of our interesting prisoner has requested the Government
    to allow a commission, consisting of the medical
    superintendents at Broadmore, Hanwell and Colney Hatch, with
    six other English experts in insanity, to come out to Australia
    to inquire into the mental condition of the prisoner. A
    telegram has also been despatched to Lord SALISBURY requesting
    that the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE OF ENGLAND and an Old Bailey Jury
    may be sent out to try the case; otherwise there will be "no
    chance of justice being done." The British PREMIER's reply has
    not yet been received. It is believed that he is consulting Mr.
    GOSCHEN about the probable cost of such a step.</p>

    <p>MELBOURNE. <i>Latest</i>.&mdash;Through the instrumentality
    of an Official connected with the prison, I am enabled to send
    you some important information concerning our prisoner which
    you may take as absolutely authentic. His breakfast this
    morning consisted of buttered toast, coffee, and poached eggs.
    He complained that the latter were not new-laid, and became
    very excited. It has also transpired that he is strangely in
    favour of Imperial Federation, and he has declared to his
    gaolers that "The friendship between England and her Colonies
    ought to be cemented." This expression of opinion has created a
    profound sensation.</p>

    <h2>THE POINT OF VIEW.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>As Private Tommy Atkins puts it to his Comrade
    Bill.</i>)</h4>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[In the Report of Lord WANTAGE's Committee, it appears
        that our Home Army costs seventeen and a-half millions per
        annum. The Duke of CAMBRIDGE doubts if we could rapidly
        mobilise one Army Corps. Sir EVELYN WOOD holds half the men
        under him at Aldershot are not equal to doing a day's
        service, even in England. The Duke of CONNAUGHT says half
        the battalions under his command are no good for service,
        cannot even carry their kits, and are not fit to march.
        Lord WOLSELEY, it is stated, compares the British Army to a
        "squeezed lemon."]</p>

    <h3>ROBERT ON THE HARTISTIC COPPERASHUN.</h3>

    <p>Oh, ain't the Copperashun jest a cummin out in the Hi Art
    line! Why, dreckly as they let it be nown as they was a willin
    to make room in their bewtifool Galery for any of the finest
    picters in the hole country as peepel was wantin to send there,
    jest to let the world no as they'd got 'em, and that they wos
    considered good enuff by the LORD MARE and the Sherriffs and
    all the hole Court of Haldermen, than they came a poring in in
    such kwantities, that pore Mr. WELSH, the Souperintendant, was
    obligated to arsk all the hole Court of common Counselmen, what
    on airth he was to do with 'em, and they told him to hinsult
    the Libery Committee on the matter, and they, like the lerned
    gents as they is, told him to take down sum of the werry
    biggest and the most strikingest as they'd got of their hone
    Picters and ang 'em up in the Gildhall Westybool, as they calls
    it, coz it's in the East, I spose, and so make room for a lot
    of the littel uns as had been sent to 'em, coz they was painted
    by "Old Marsters," tho' who "Old Marsters" was, I, for one,
    never could make out, xcep that he must have well deserved his
    Nickname, considering the number of picters as he must ha'
    painted. And now cums won of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> werry cleverest dodges as
       even a Welsh Souperintendant of Gildhall picturs coud
       posserbly have thort on. Why what does he do? but he has
       taken down out of the Gallery, won of the werry biggest, and
       one of the werry grandest, Picters of moddern times, and has
       hung it up in the Westybool aforesaid, to take the whole
       shine out of all the little uns as so many hemnent swells
       had been ony too glad to send to Gildhall&mdash;"the paytron
       of the Harts," as I herd a hemnent Halderman call
       it,&mdash;to give 'em the reel stamp as fust rate.</p>

    <p>And now what does my thousands of readers suppose was the
    subjeck of this werry grandest of all Picters? Why, no other
    than a most magniffisent, splendid, gorgeus, large as life
    representashun of the LORD MARE's Show, a cummin in all its
    full bewty and splender from the middel of the Royal
    Xchange!!</p>

    <p>But ewen that isn't all. For the Painter of this trewly
    hartistic Picter, determined to make his grand work as truthful
    as it is striking, has lawished his hole sole, so to speak,
    upon what are undoubtedly the most commanding figures in the
    hole glorious display, and them is the LORD MARE's three
    Gentlemen! with their wands of power, and their glorious
    Unyforms, not forgetting their luvly silk stockins; on this
    occasion, too, spotless as the rising Sun! To say that they are
    the hobservd of all hobservers, and the hadmirashun of all the
    fare sex, and the henvy of the other wun, need not be said, tho
    they do try to hide their gelesy with a sickly smile.</p>

    <p>Need I say that it is surrounded ewery day by a sercle of
    smiling admirers, who, I have no doubt, come agane and agane,
    to show it to their admiring friends; and, just to prove its
    grand success, the werry last time as I was there, I owerheard
    a smiling gent say to his friend,&mdash;"Well, TOM, as this is
    such a success, it would not supprise me if the same hemnent
    Hartis was to paint the LORD MARE's Bankwet next year, with all
    the Nobel Harmy of Waiters arranged in front!" Wich Harmy will
    be pussinelly konduktid by your faithful</p>

        worst offences he can commit. This notice is not addressed
        to men alone. Of the young women employed by the
        department, there are, he says, some, if not many, whom it
        is impossible to acquit of inattention and levity in the
        discharge of their official duties. It is Sir JAMES

        <p><i>First Mem. of the Pub.</i> (<i>furious</i>). A

        costing a penny each. See?</p>

        <p><i>First Emp.</i> (<i>with calm unconcern</i>). Then why

        for India?</p>

        <p><i>First Emp.</i> Well, the sea air <i>is</i> the sea

        <p><i>Second Emp.</i> I must say, dear, you have the most

        charmed with them! Absolutely charmed!</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem, of the Pub.</i> (<i>louder still</i>).

        <p><i>First Emp.</i> Oh, you <i>are</i> in a hurry! (<i>To

        They don't sell them at the Stores.</p>

        <p><i>Second Mem. of the Pub.</i> (<i>in a loud tone of

        <p><i>Second Mem. of the Pub.</i> (<i>in a voice of

        <p><i>First Emp.</i> And who may you be?</p>

    <h3>A CURSORY OBSERVATION.</h3>

    <p>From the <i>Figaro</i> for Dimanche, April 17, we make this
    extract:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"SPORTS ATHLÉTIQUES.&mdash;Le match international de
        foot ball entre le Stade Français et le Rosslyn Park foot
        ball Club de Londres sera joué demain sur le terrain du
        Cursing Club de France à Levallois. L'équipe anglaise est
        arrivée à Paris hier soir. Le match sera présidé par le
        marquis de Dufferin."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>"The Cursing Club!" What an awful name! For what purpose are
    they banded together? Is it to curse one another by their gods?
    to issue forth on <i>premières</i> to damn a new play? What
    fearful language would be just audible, curses, not loud but
    deep, during the progress of the Foot-ball Match over which the
    Marquis of DUFFERIN is to preside! It is all over by now; but
    the result we have not seen. We hope there is no Cursing Club
    in England. There existed, once upon a time, in London, a Club
    with an awful Tartarian name, which might have been a parent
    society to a Cursing Club. Let us trust&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[*** The Editor puts short the article at this point,
        being of opinion that "Cursing" is only a misprint for
        "Coursing;" or, if not, he certainly gives <i>Le Figaro</i>
        the benefit of the doubt. Note, also, that the match was to
        be played on "Cursing Club Ground," lent for the occasion,
        and was not to be played by Members of the "C.C."]</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> You wish to describe how you were
        enlisted?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> Yes, my Lord. It was in this way. I had
        returned from some races in a dog-cart with a villain. We
        stopped at a wayside public-house kept by a comic
        Irishman.</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> Hear me, my Lord; hear me! I confess it, I
        took too much to drink. Yes, my Lord, I was drunk! And then
        a Sergeant in the Dragoon Guards gave me a shilling, and
        placed some ribands in my pot-hat, and&mdash;well&mdash;I
        was a soldier! Yes, a soldier! And as a soldier was refused
        permission to visit my dying mother!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> Were there no other legal formalities in
        connection with your enlistment? For instance&mdash;Were
        you not taken before an attesting Magistrate?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> No, my Lord, no! I was carried off
        protesting, while my villanous friend disappeared with my
        sweetheart! It was cruel, my Lord and Gentlemen! It was
        very cruel!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> Did you desert?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> I did, my Lord&mdash;after I had obtained a
        uniform fitting closely to the figure; but it was only that
        I might obtain the blessing of my mother! And when I
        returned home the soldiers followed me&mdash;and might have
        killed me!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> How was that?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> When I had taken refuge in a haystack, they
        prodded the haystack with their swords! And this is life in
        the Army!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> Were you arrested on discovery?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> No; they spared me that indignity! They saw,
        my Lord, that my mother was dying, and respectfully fell
        back while I assisted the old Lady to pass away peacefully.
        But then, after all, they were men. In spite of their red
        patrol jackets, brass helmets, and no spurs, they were men,
        my Lord,&mdash;men! And, as soldiers, after I had broken
        from prison, and was accused of murder, they again released
        me, because some one promised to buy my discharge!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> And where are you quartered?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> At the Royal Princess's Theatre, Oxford
        Street, where I have these strange experiences of
        discipline, and where I am enlisted in the unconventional,
        not to say illegal, way I have described, nightly; nay,
        sometimes twice daily!</p>

        <p><i>Chair.</i> And why have you proffered your
        evidence?</p>

        <p><i>Wit.</i> Because I think the Public ought to know, my

    <h2>THE YOUNG GIRL'S COMPANION.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mrs. Payley,</i>)</h4>

    <h3>II.&mdash;DINING-OUT.</h3>

    <p>I can quite understand that a young girl may not care much
    for the mere material dinner. The palate is a pleasure of
    maturity. The woman of fifty probably includes a menu or two
    among her most sacred memories; but the young girl is capable
    of dining on part of a cutlet, any pink sweetmeat, and some
    tea. But I must confess that I was surprised at another
    objection to dining-out that a young girl, only at the end of
    her second season, once made to me. She said that she
    positively could not stand any longer the conversation of the
    average young man of Society. I asked her why, and she then
    asserted that this sort of young man confined himself to flat
    badinage and personal brag, which he was mistaken in believing
    to be veiled. What she said was, of course, perfectly true.
    Civilisation is responsible for the flat badinage, for
    civilisation requires that conversation shall be light and
    amusing, but can provide no remedy for slow wits; on the other
    hand, the personal brag is a relic of the original man. The
    badinage is the young man's defect in art; the brag is his
    defect in nature. But I fail to see any objection to such
    conversation; on the contrary, it is charming because it
    <i>is</i> so average; you know beforehand just what you will
    hear and just what you will say, and everything is consequently
    made easy. The man puts on that kind of talk just as he puts on
    his dress-coat; both are part of the evening uniform. The motto
    of the perfect young man of Society is "I resemble." I pointed
    all this out to the young girl in question, and she retorted
    that it was a pity that silence was a lost art. However, she
    continued to dine-out and to take her part in the only possible
    conversation, and after all Society rather encourages
    theoretical rebellion, provided that it is accompanied by
    practical submission.</p>

    </div>

    <p>From the point of view of sentiment, a dinner has less
    potentialities than a dance; but the dinner may begin what the
    dance will end; you set light to the fuse in the dining-room,
    and the explosion takes place six weeks afterwards in
    someone-else's conservatory. Nothing much can be done on the
    staircase; but, if you can decently pretend that you have heard
    of the young man who is taking you in, he will probably like
    it. If, after a few minutes, you decide that it is worth while
    to interest the young man, discourage his flat badinage, and
    encourage his personal brag. The only thing in which it is
    quite certain that every man will be interested is, the
    interest someone else takes in him. Later on, he will probably
    be induced to illustrate the topic of conversation by telling
    you (if it would not bore you) of a little incident which
    happened to himself. The incident will be prettily coloured for
    dinner-table use, and he will make the story prove a merit in
    himself, which he will take care to disclaim vainly. When he
    has finished, look very meditatively at your plate, as if you
    saw visions in it, and then turn on him suddenly with wide
    eyes&mdash;with the right kind of eyelashes, this is
    effective.</p>

    <p>"I suppose you don't know it, Mr. BLANK," you tell him, "but
    really I can't help saying it. You behaved
    splendidly&mdash;splendidly!"</p>

    <p>Droop the eyelashes quickly, and become meditative again. He
    will deprecate your compliment a little incoherently.</p>

    <p>"Not at all, not at
    all&mdash;Miss&mdash;er&mdash;ASTERISK&mdash;I
    really&mdash;assure you&mdash;nothing more than
    any&mdash;er&mdash;other man would have done. Some other people
    at the time told me"&mdash;(<i>laughs
    nervously</i>)&mdash;"very much&mdash;er&mdash;what you have
    just said, but&mdash;er&mdash;personally,
    I&mdash;really&mdash;could never see it, or of course I
    wouldn't have mentioned it to you."</p>

    <p>Your rejoinder will depend a good deal on how far you mean
    to go, and how much of that kind of thing you think you can
    stand. If you like, you can drop your handkerchief or your
    glove when you rise; it will please him to pick it up for you,
    and he will feel, for a moment, as if he had saved your
    life.</p>

    <p>If you do not want to please the man, but only to show your
    own superiority, it may perhaps be as well to remember that
    women are better than men, as a rule, in flat badinage. Men
    talk best when they are by themselves, but they are liable to
    be painfully natural at such times. I had some little
    difficulty in finding this out, but I thought it my duty to
    know, and&mdash;well, I <i>do</i> know.</p>

    <p>The correspondence that I have received has not been
    altogether pleasant. I have had one letter from ETHEL (aged
    thirteen) saying that she thinks me a mean sneak for prying
    into other people's Diaries. I can only reply that I was acting
    for the public good. I have had a sweet letter, however, from
    "AZALEA." She has been absolutely compelled, by force of
    circumstances, to allow the distinct attentions of three
    different men. She does not give the names of the men, only
    descriptions, but I should advise her to keep the dark one. She
    can see the will at Somerset House. "JANE" writes to ask what
    is the best cure for freckles. I do not answer questions of
    that kind. I have replied to my other correspondents
    privately.</p>

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
